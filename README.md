# blog-maker
This is a dynamic blog maker web app created using Node.js, HTML and CSS. It uses EJS templating to allow users to create custom blog posts through a /compose route. Post requests were implemented to dynamically display newly created posts on the homepage and Express routing parameters were used to render a new page per post through an algorithm that searches through a posts array.

Next steps: Implement MongoDB and deploy the app to a server.
